    description: `Hello World! Originally from Carson City, NV, I am a member of Dartmouth College's class of 2024 where I intend to pursue Computer Science and Engineering. I enjoy exploring new frameworks and languages, as I always strive to improve my professional coding abilities. I hope to go into full-stack development or explore the field of Artificial Intelligence! I am also excited to announce that this Spring I will be heading to Natick, MA as an Engineering Development Group (EDG) Intern at Mathworks!`
