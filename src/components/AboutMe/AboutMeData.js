    description: `Hello World! Originally from Carson City, NV, I am a member of Dartmouth College's class of 2024 where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science Modified with Engineering, and a minor in Music. I enjoy exploring new frameworks and languages, as I always strive to improve my professional coding abilities. I hope to employ my industry knowledge in Full-Stack development while also learning about AI and VR/AR! I recently finished my Internship at Roblox, working on the new Hash Map Data Structure for the MemoryStore Service in Creator Studio, now in private beta! I am largely interested in backend cloud services, smart algorithms for data analysis and management, and working on complex technical challenges.`
